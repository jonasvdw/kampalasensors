# iButton temperature/humidity sensors at Kampala

This repo includes Python scripts supplemented to _Van de Walle et al. (2021)_ aiming at:
- postprocessing raw iButton observations to a well-structured csv file (`preproces`)
- reading those csv files to create main manuscript figures (`figscripts`)

Scripts can be executing with standard python installation and some additional packages. A summary of all packages is given in the `kampalasensors.yml` file. More information on the conda installation from yml files can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html "Managing conda environments").
